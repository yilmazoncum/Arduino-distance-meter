 
This is a distance calculator that measures the distance and transmits the calculated value to the interface.

Arduino mesures distance with "HC-SR04" and transmits the calculated data to the interface with "HC05" bt module.

You have 3 options in the interface:
1-dimension measurment shows you the distance and its inch version, also it shows a scaled line.
2-dimension measurment is also shows you field value and scaled field image for you.
3-dimension measurment does the same things with volume.

Use 1, 2, 3 keys to make measurements and select a menu.
